# Titanic Survival Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced pandas skills in a Jupyter Notebook environment, analyzing passenger survival patterns from the Titanic disaster. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, survival analysis, and professional visualizations.

## Features

- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering with categorical binning
- Survival rate analysis by demographics
- Fare comparison between survivors and non-survivors
- Professional visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Cleaned dataset export

## Data Source

The Titanic passenger dataset is loaded directly from kaggle data set:

```python
titanic = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
```

## Tasks Performed

**Data Loading & Initial Inspection**
- Loaded CSV from URL
- Displayed first 8 rows
- Checked data types and summary statistics
- Identified missing values

**Data Cleaning**
- Filled missing age values with class-based medians
- Converted gender to binary numerical values
- Dropped irrelevant columns (Cabin, Name)

**Feature Engineering**
- Created `FamilySize` feature
- Added `IsAlone` flag
- Binned ages into categories (Child, Teen, Adult, Senior)

**Survival Analysis**
- Calculated overall survival rate
- Compared survival rates by gender, class, and family status
- Identified top 3 age groups with highest survival rates

**Fare Analysis**
- Compared average fares between survivors/non-survivors
- Analyzed fare distribution by passenger class
- Identified classes with largest fare gaps

**Advanced Operations**
- Grouped analysis using `groupby()` + `agg()`
- Created pivot tables for multi-dimensional analysis

**Visualizations**
- Survival rate by passenger class (bar plot)
- Gender distribution of survivors (pie chart)
- Fare distribution by survival status (box plot)
- Age distribution with KDE curve (histogram)

## Key Findings

- Overall survival rate: **38.2%**
- Female passengers had **74.2%** survival rate vs **18.9%** for males
- 1st class passengers had **62.5%** survival rate vs **24.2%** in 3rd class
- Children (<13) had the highest survival rate among age groups
- Survivors paid significantly higher fares on average ($48.40 vs $22.12)
